## NAME
**Determining MLB Pitcher Salaries**


## GOAL

*The goal of the project was to determine a regression model to estimate a pitchers salary based off of the specific stats in the field*

## FILES USED

Our group created a [Powerpoint](https://iowa-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/greenhill_uiowa_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B697EC2E3-5DB8-4C29-AA78-18F5D8A6C2DC%7D&file=BA%20FInal%20Presentation.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&login_hint=jsheithoff%40uiowa.edu&ct=1695181941740&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.START.EDGEWORTH&cid=5835b9b1-9dbb-49a9-abbc-b42c2b0abf9a&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=eaaa0c67-fd78-4e74-a259-025a384143cf) to demonstrate our regression equation model.



## WHY
We had several reasons we wanted to analyze this data
1. Determine if there was a correlation between salaries and statistics
2. Determine what statistic had the most unfluence on the salary
3. Determine if the top 50 pitcher list we used was an accurate list based off our findings


## WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?

We determined that there was no specfiic correlation between any of the three statistics (Strikeouts, Walks, ERA) and pitcher salary. The stats were to strayed and inconsistent to find a common trend. The stat that did play the most impact was strikeouts which we agreed made the most sense with the data. We finalized that due to contracts being put on a multi year basis, before the season begins. Rather than being paid **based** on the performance from the season.
